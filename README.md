![Herp Fortress running on Arch Linux using KDE Plasma](screenshot.png)

Herp Fortress Rewritten is an rewrite of the original source code of Herp Fortress written by Minecraft's original developer, Markus "Notch" Persson which can be found [here](https://github.com/TeutonicCode/HerpFortress).

Since the original source doesn't have an license, Rewritten is dedicated to the public domain using [The Unlicense](LICENSE.txt).

## Differences from the original

- Added an window icon that's based on Gang Garrison 2 with some minor changes.
- Added an debug screen which replaces printing FPS counter with graphical one.
  - Can be shown by pressing <kbd>F3</kbd> key.
- Minor code refactors.
- and more...

## Getting the game

### Binary downloads

This section assumes that you need Java 8 or higher installed, which can be downloaded from [the official Java website](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) if you're using Windows, or the distro's package manager.

#### Linux

- Arch-based (Manjaro, Endeavour, etc.): `pacman -S jre8-openjdk`
- Debian-based (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.): `apt -S openjdk-8-jre`
- Fedora-based (Nobara, etc.): `yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk`

#### Generic

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/TeutonicCode/HFRewritten/releases).
2. Select `HerpFortress.jar`.
  - Some browsers like Chrome may flag the jar file as soon as it's downloaded, this isn't a virus so it's safe to allow them.
3. Run the downloaded file by (double-)clicking the jar file.
4. "Stay frosty." - Soldier.

### Compiling from source

This section assumes that you need at least OpenJDK 8 installed, which can be downloaded from [Adoptium website](https://adoptium.net/) if you're using Windows or the Linux distribution that doesn't have an specific package, or the distro's package manager.

#### Linux

- Arch-based (Manjaro, Endeavour, etc.): `pacman -S jdk8-openjdk`
- Debian-based (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.): `apt -S openjdk-8-jdk`
- Fedora-based (Nobara, etc.): `yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel`

This repository has pre-made build scripts you can run on.

Run `Compile.bat` for Windows, or `compile.sh` for Linux, and wait until the prompt has appeared.

You will find an folder named `bin` where the compiled jar file can be found.

There's another bat/shell script (`Compile.bat`/`compile.sh`) which only compiles the code and not packs them up in jar.
